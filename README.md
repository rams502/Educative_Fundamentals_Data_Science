# Building Fundamentals for Data Science

## Why this course?
Data is the new oil but it comes as crude, just like the oil. To do anything meaningful - modeling, visualization, machine learning, or predictive analysis – you first need to wrestle and wrangle with data. This course teaches the essential basics of data wrangling using Python.

## Learning Objectives
* Understand the properties and usage of the fundamental data structures in Python language
* Acquire detailed knowledge about NumPy and Pandas – two of the most important Python libraries for analytics/data science
* Learn various connections that can be made with Python for sourcing and extracting data – normal text file, SQL, CSV, Excel, JSON, XML, etc.
* Learn how to extract information from web using Python libraries – BeautifulSoup4, html5lib
* Understand how to use regular expression (RegEx) technique for search and information retrieval from textual data
* Learn how to handle missing or outlier data and basic imputation techniques
* Acquire basic understanding of descriptive statistics and plotting techniques in Python for quick examination of data
* Bonus topic – random data generation techniques for practicing data wrangling and modeling beyond this course
